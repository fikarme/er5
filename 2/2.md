In the Warlock, SpellBook and TargetGenerator classes,
the switch statement is FORBIDDEN

Create the following two spells, on the same model as Fwoosh:

* Fireball (Name: "Fireball", Effects: "burnt to a crisp")
* Polymorph (Name: "Polymorph", Effects: "turned into a critter")

In addition to this, just so he won't have only dummy to attack,
let's make a new target for him, which will be the BrickWall
(Type: "Inconspicuous Red-brick Wall").

Now, make a SpellBook class, in canonical form,
that can't be copied or instantiated by copy.
It will have the following functions:

* void learnSpell(ASpell*),
    COPIES a spell in the book

* void forgetSpell(string const &),
    deletes a spell from the book, except if it isn't there

* ASpell* createSpell(string const &),
    receives a string corresponding to the name of a spell,
    creates it, and returns it.

Modify the Warlock, now, make it have a spell book
that will be created with him and destroyed with him.
Also make his learnSpell and forgetSpell functions
call those of the spell book.

The launchSpell function will have to use the SpellBook
to create the spell it's attempting to launch.

Make a TargetGenerator class, in canonical form,
and as before, non-copyable.

It will have the following functions:

* void learnTargetType(ATarget*)
    teaches a target to the generator

* void forgetTargetType(string const &)
    makes the generator forget a target type if it's known

* ATarget* createTarget(string const &)
    creates a target of the specified type
